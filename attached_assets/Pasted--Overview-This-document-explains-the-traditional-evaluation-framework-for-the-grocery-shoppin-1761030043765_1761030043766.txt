## OverviewThis document explains the **traditional evaluation framework** for the grocery shopping recommendation systems. Unlike LLM-based evaluation (which uses GPT-5 for subjective quality assessment), traditional metrics provide **objective, quantitative measurements** using proven industry-standard formulas.## Why Traditional Metrics?### Advantages- ✅ **No API costs** - Unlike GPT-5 evaluation- ✅ **Instant results** - No waiting for LLM responses- ✅ **Objective & repeatable** - Same input = same output- ✅ **Industry standard** - Used by Amazon, Netflix, Spotify- ✅ **Easy to track** - Monitor improvements over time- ✅ **Scientific rigor** - Based on peer-reviewed research### Use Cases- **A/B Testing**: Compare different recommendation algorithms- **Performance Monitoring**: Track system quality over time- **Optimization**: Identify which metrics need improvement- **Reporting**: Provide data-driven insights to stakeholders---## Evaluation Results (Live Session)### Latest Results with Real Purchase History| System | Recommendations | Total Savings | Avg Savings/Item | Savings % | Diversity | Category Match | Reasonable Pricing ||--------|----------------|---------------|------------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|--------------------|| **Personalized CF** | **9** | **$50.60** | **$5.62** | **52.7%** | 0.33 | 0.56 | 22.2% || **Hybrid AI** | **8** | **$46.60** | **$5.83** | **48.6%** | 0.38 | 0.62 | 25.0% || Budget-Saving | 0 | $0.00 | $0.00 | 0.0% | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.0% |**Test Scenario:**- Budget: $80.00- Cart Total: $82.97- Over Budget: $2.97- Cart Items: 5 (Batteries, Laundry Detergent, Beef Jerky, Chocolate, Olive Oil)---## Metrics Explained### 1. Recommendations Count**Definition**: Number of cheaper alternative products suggested**Interpretation:**- More recommendations = more options for users- Too many (>10) can overwhelm users- **Optimal range**: 5-8 recommendations**Current Performance:**- Personalized CF: 9 ✅ (Good)- Hybrid AI: 8 ✅ (Optimal)---### 2. Total Savings ($)**Definition**: Sum of all potential savings if all recommendations are accepted**Formula**: `Σ (Original Price - Suggested Price) for all recommendations`**Interpretation:**- Higher savings = better budget impact- Should be substantial enough to justify switching- **Good target**: >40% of cart total**Current Performance:**- Personalized CF: $50.60 ✅ (61% of cart total - Excellent!)- Hybrid AI: $46.60 ✅ (56% of cart total - Excellent!)---### 3. Average Savings per Item ($)**Definition**: Mean saving per recommendation**Formula**: `Total Savings / Number of Recommendations`**Interpretation:**- Shows typical savings magnitude per suggestion- Higher = more impactful individual recommendations- **Good target**: >$5/item for grocery shopping**Current Performance:**- Personalized CF: $5.62 ✅ (Good)- Hybrid AI: $5.83 ✅ (Better)---### 4. Savings Percentage (%)**Definition**: Percentage of total cart cost that could be saved**Formula**: `(Total Savings / Cart Total) × 100`**Interpretation:**- Measures overall budget impact- Higher = more effective at reducing costs- **Good target**: >40%**Current Performance:**- Personalized CF: 52.7% ✅ (Excellent - over half cart cost!)- Hybrid AI: 48.6% ✅ (Excellent)---### 5. Diversity Score**Definition**: Variety of product categories in recommendations**Formula**: `Unique Categories / Total Recommendations`**Range**: 0.0 (all same category) to 1.0 (all different categories)**Interpretation:**- Higher = better variety, avoids repetitive suggestions- Too low (<0.3) = too narrow- **Good target**: 0.4-0.7**Current Performance:**- Personalized CF: 0.33 ⚠️ (Slightly low - could diversify more)- Hybrid AI: 0.38 ✅ (Good)---### 6. Category Match**Definition**: How often recommendations match original item's category**Formula**: `(Matching Categories / Total Recommendations)`**Range**: 0.0 (no matches) to 1.0 (perfect match)**Interpretation:**- Higher = better relevance to user's original choice- Too low = suggestions may seem random- **Good target**: 0.5-0.8**Current Performance:**- Personalized CF: 0.56 ✅ (Good - 56% match original categories)- Hybrid AI: 0.62 ✅ (Better - 62% relevance)---### 7. Reasonable Pricing (%)**Definition**: Percentage of recommendations with appropriate discount levels**Criteria:**- Discount too small (<5%): Not worth switching- Discount too large (>70%): Suspiciously cheap, quality concerns- **Reasonable range**: 5-70% discount**Formula**: `(Reasonable Recommendations / Total Recommendations) × 100`**Interpretation:**- Higher = more realistic, trustworthy suggestions- Low score = either trivial or unrealistic discounts- **Good target**: >60%**Current Performance:**- Personalized CF: 22.2% ⚠️ (Low - some extreme discounts)- Hybrid AI: 25.0% ⚠️ (Low - needs calibration)---
