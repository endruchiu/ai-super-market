          "reasoning": "All recommendations target replacing the Wagyu with much cheaper prepared meats, yielding about $1,000 savings but still leaving the cart over budget and ignoring the duplicate high-cost caviar. The suggested items are not realistic substitutes for a 12-lb A5 roast (tiny charcuterie, tamales, dumplings), making acceptance unlikely despite solid savings math. Explanations are generic and overstate similarity."
